    <h1>Ganeti Features</h1>
    <p>
      Ganeti provides a variety of virtualisation and storage options. However, currently not all of them are
      maintained in a way we would like them to be. If you are using one of the unmaintaned features and would
      like to help with (automated) testing and development, please visit the <a href="/community.html">community</a>
      page and get in contact with us!
